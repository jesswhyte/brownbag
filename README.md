This repository contains example code from the ACM Brown Bag lunch workshop 'Accessing the Twitter API with Python', hosted at Semaphore Studio 307 by me.

The files are as follows:

**simplerest.py** - an example REST API request for a search term query

**restauth.py** - an expansion on simplerest.py, but stores its authorization info in a separate .json file (twitterConfig.json)

**restauthdump.py** - expansion on restauth.py that dumps returned tweets to a .json 

**simplestream.py** - example for accessing the Streaming API and filtering by search term and language. 

**twitterConfig.json** - example of a json file for storing access keys and tokens
